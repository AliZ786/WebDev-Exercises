        <h2>The history of the NBA</h2>
        <img src="nba.jpg" width="700">
        
        <p>The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony.</p>
        <p> The game has since evolved however, and has become the biggest international sport due to the emergence of the NBA, the National BasketBall Association. </p>
